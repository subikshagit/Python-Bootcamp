100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp (Udemy)

This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and notes I completed while taking the “100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp” course on Udemy.
It serves as my personal learning log, where I track my progress and build hands-on projects to strengthen my Python foundation.

About the Course

This Udemy course takes you from the basics of Python to more advanced concepts in a very practical and project-focused way.
Across 100 days, it starts with fundamentals like variables, loops, and functions, and gradually moves into topics such as object-oriented programming, desktop applications, automation, APIs, web development, and data-related concepts.

Each day focuses on one concept and usually ends with a short exercise or a complete project.
The structure makes sure you learn by doing rather than just watching.
